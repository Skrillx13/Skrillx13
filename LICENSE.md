# Notice:

The Documents inside this GitHub Repository has been placed in the public domain. 

## What this means:

You are free to do whatever you wish to do with thie documents in this repository. Yes, that includes, forking, distributing (open and closed source) copies of the documents, and even outright steal them. But to be honest, why would you ever do that? This is a README for me to write in and describe myself, you would just be stealing what is essentially my "autobiography". Even if you distribute it, it just gives me more public awareness, hence leading my projects to be more popular. Here's a tip, instead of stealing other people's personalities, (and apparently README's), learn to write one yourself.

## Final Words

Thats all I have to say for this LICENSE text. Feel free to explore my profile and do whatever, just don't steal my projects that actually have a LICENSE on them. Thanks!
